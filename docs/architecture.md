# System Architecture


# Data Flow

There is one manager for Model session/lifetime in RAM.

In RAM, all AI models are loaded on startup and the ModelSession manager provides a get() method for each model. The model implementations are in their own '<model>_agent.py' classes and those classes have the model path stored in src/core/config.py where any model can be swapped in/out as per convenience.

Each user session has a user ID generated by frontend per-device that depends on the cache.
